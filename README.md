  Passionate about crafting seamless mobile experiences, I started with MATLAB for research but quickly fell in love with Flutter and Firebase.
  <strong>From AI‑driven wellness apps to launching CannaBook, my journey has been a deep dive into front‑end finesse.</strong>

  <br/>
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by creating intuitive apps that shape users’ daily lives in meaningful ways—whether it’s a mindfulness platform reaching millions or an AI tool that personalizes healthcare. Starting in MATLAB for academic research, I discovered my passion for front‑end craft, leading me to master Flutter, Firebase, and cross‑platform development.
    From building <strong>AI‑driven</strong> wellness apps to launching <strong>CannaBook</strong>, my journey has been about creating experiences that truly impact people’s well‑being and productivity.<br/><br/>
    Now, I'm on a mission to push the boundaries of what mobile apps can do—leveraging <em>AI, analytics, and beautiful design</em> to bring next‑gen solutions to life.
