<!-- CODING JOURNEY -->
<h2 id="-my-coding-journey">üöÄ My Coding Journey</h2>
<p>
  My journey in tech began in Germany, where I conducted biomechanics research and published peer-reviewed work using MATLAB‚Äîlearning precision and data analysis along the way. When COVID-19 forced lab closures, I pivoted from science to software engineering, driven by a desire to build mobile experiences that truly resonate.
</p>
<p>
  I embraced Flutter and Firebase to craft innovative, high-performance mobile solutions. Since joining Reflective Technologies in September 2021, I‚Äôve led teams through every phase of app development‚Äîfrom early Figma designs to full-scale production‚Äîacross projects that span guided meditation audio streaming, habit tracking, AI-enhanced journaling, and much more!
</p>
<p>
  Every line of code is an opportunity to solve real-world challenges, blending my passion for software, science, and health with a relentless drive to innovate and excel.
